Task 1.2: Database Schema Documentation1. Entity-Relationship DescriptionENTITY: customersPurpose: Stores unique profile information for every registered user.Attributes:customer_id: Unique identifier (Primary Key).first_name: Customer's given name.last_name: Customer's family name.email: Unique email address used for login and notifications.registration_date: The timestamp when the customer joined the platform.Relationships:One customer can place MANY sales (1:M relationship with the sales table).ENTITY: productsPurpose: Maintains the master catalog of items available for purchase.Attributes:product_id: Unique identifier (Primary Key).product_name: The official name of the item.category: The group the product belongs to (e.g., Electronics, Apparel).stock_quantity: Number of items currently available in the warehouse.Relationships:One product can be sold in MANY different transactions (1:M relationship with the sales table).ENTITY: salesPurpose: Acts as the central fact table recording every transaction.Attributes:transaction_id: Unique identifier for each individual sale (Primary Key).transaction_date: The specific date and time the purchase occurred.customer_id: Reference to the customer who made the purchase (Foreign Key).product_id: Reference to the item being sold (Foreign Key).quantity: The number of units purchased in the transaction.unit_price: The price per unit at the exact time of the sale.Relationships:Many sales are linked to ONE customer (M:1).Many sales are linked to ONE product (M:1).2. Normalization Explanation (3NF)This database design adheres to the Third Normal Form (3NF) to ensure data integrity and eliminate redundancy.Functional DependenciesEvery non-key attribute in this schema is functionally dependent only on the Primary Key of its respective table. For instance, in the customers table, the email and first_name are determined solely by the customer_id. In the sales table, the quantity and transaction_date depend entirely on the transaction_id. There are no transitive dependencies (e.g., a customer's address depending on their phone number rather than their ID), which satisfies the requirements for 3NF.Avoiding AnomaliesBy separating data into specific entities, we avoid the three core database anomalies:Insert Anomaly: We can add a new product to the products table (e.g., "Smart Watch") without needing to have a sale recorded for it first.Update Anomaly: If a customer changes their email address, we only need to update it in one row in the customers table. The change is automatically reflected across all historical sales because the sales table only stores the customer_id.Delete Anomaly: If we delete a specific transaction from the sales table, we do not lose the product's information or the customer's profile, as they exist independently in their own master tables.3.
